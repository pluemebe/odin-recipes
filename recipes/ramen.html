        <h2>Description</h2>
        For hangover days. (Enough said :p)

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Your choice of instant ramen</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Bok choy</li>
            <li>Green onions</li>
            <li>Fish sauce</li>
            <li>Sesame oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prep all your ingredients! This cooks very quickly, and you
                don't want your noodles to go soggy.</li>
            <li>Add in half of the flavour pack into your pot of water, then
                boil. Once the water has boil, carefully add in your eggs.</li>
            <li>Depending on how cooked you like your eggs, add in your noodles.
                Continue boiling mixture until noodles are al dente.</li>
            <li>Add bok choy, then turn off heat. Let the residual temperature
                cook the bok choy</li>
            <li>Top ramen with green onions, fish sauce, and sesame oil. If 
                the broth is not salty enough, add in more of the flavour pack.</li>
        </ol>
