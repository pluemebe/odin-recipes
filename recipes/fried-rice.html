		<h2>Description</h2>
		Simple, savory, and was called "delicious" by my boyfriend, this Hibachi
		tasting fried rice recipe is for us lazy girls who can't cook. It can be
		easily customized to fit your taste, but this is what I'd accidently
		cooked up one day!

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Old rice</li>
			<li>Eggs</li>
			<li>Sesame oil</li>
			<li>Butter</li>
			<li>Garlic powder</li>
			<li>Black pepper</li>
			<li>Salt</li>
			<li>Green onions</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>On medium heat, add butter to the pan and half fry eggs 
				(<i>note:</i> The eggs should be a bit runny). Once cooked, 
				transfer eggs to a bowl.</li>
			<li>Add sesame oil to the pan and increase temperature to high.
				Pan fry rice with butter, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.
				To give the Hibachi taste, add more oil if needed, and continue
				to cook rice on high heat.</li>
			<li>Once rice seems nearly ready, add eggs and continue to mix.</li>
			<li>Turn off heat, and garnish with green onions and black pepper.</li>
		</ol>
