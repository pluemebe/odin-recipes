		<h2>Description</h2>
		Eggs and tofu are my favourite foods. If egg were tofu, this is it.
		
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Eggs</li>
			<li>Water</li>
			<li>Fish sauce</li>
			<li><i>optional:</i> Green onions</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Beat the eggs and fish sauce in a small bowl.</li>
			<li>Add a 1:1 ratio of water to the egg-fish sauce mixture.</li>
			<li>With a spoon, remove the air bubbles at the top layer 
				of the mixture.</li>
			<li>Fill a pot with water to the height of the egg mixture (i.e., 
				does not need to reach the bowl's full height) and heat to
				medium temperature.</li>
			<li>Cover the bowl in foil and carefully place into the pot. Boil
				for at least 10 minutes (or until egg is fully cooked).</li>
			<li><i>optional:</i> Before the egg is completely boiled, add in
				green onions and black pepper</li>
		</ol>
